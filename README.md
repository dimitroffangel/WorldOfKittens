Fantasy Kittens and How to find them
===============


Kittens and necroKittens everywhere

# Main tasks

- Create 2 kittens with a random colour
- Make a colony where they age
- Make incarnation cats
- Make exploding cats
- Make the colony do stuff on some turn such as:
	Exploding kittens kill itself and kills the two around it
	CyborgKittens replicate itself and it is a cyborgKitten again
	NecroKittens create zombie kittens which can kill people
- If a kittens becomes older than 15 years old, it dies.
- Cyborg kittens do not die until they reach age 30 -> they rot okay ?.
- The program should print a list of all the kittens in the colony each turn along w/ all the kittens details, sorted by age.
- The program should also output each turns events such as
 Kitten Fufu was born
 Kitten CyborgZoro has replicated itself
 Kitten Ultron replicates itself into an Exploding KamikazeMiau Kitten
- When all the kittens are zombies or have left none the program can stop
